// ********************************** BUGS **********************************
// APP crashes while creating account. It should login user automatically
// Make a clean install of whole repo and check/write down all steps that are essential to run this app

// ********************************** HIGH **********************************
// 0.  red/red/red - wherever I'm querying for all sessions - maybe query for specific session by ID?
// 0. There should be feature that saves user preferences/settings inside user? or some other Schema, so it will sync between devices
// 3. add image of scrambled cube  https://github.com/tdecker91/puzzle-gen
// 8. Add option to choose "Ready signal", so timer will somehow show user that it is ready to count time. Maybe color some parts of screen/change time color
// 11. Timer should also point if there is "Nowa najlepsza Å›rednia" with current solve. If yes - on time somehow pop average that is best rn and show some info above?
// 12. set finished when there is any gyro - Add options to timer settings, if on - use gyro.
// 15. Add possibility to user to add his own cubes, so he can assign each solve to a certain cube(like X-man tornado and so on) so it will be easier to filter by cube also
// 16. Try to implement better scramble generator: Scramble: https://github.com/cubing/create-cubing-app / https://js.cubing.net/cubing/
// 19. Add possibility to add new "cubes" to timer, maybe they should be separated by horizontal line. User can name them as he wants, pick any scramble generator(or no scrambler), choose icon, maybe even choose multiple scrambles together for relays?
// 21. Try to make SolveModifiers icons bigger, so user will not start new solve accidentaly?
// 23. Statistics should be zoomable(zooming in, moving around, changing the Y axis)
// 25. While adding notes - let user predefine some notes and show them as a clickable buttons. So user can add 'lucky scramble' 'great solve' 'great cross' and stuff like that so he doesnt need to write these things all the time

// ********************************** MODERATE **********************************
// 2. Set ready when front light sensor is covered.
// 4. Export to CSV/ import/export compatible with csTimer
// 5. maybe add option to create own colors for whole app? and background image for timer screen? It should be dimmed by default
// 6. add "custom" cube option so users can add their own cube without scramble/ Maybe add "custom" and users will place there their sessions?
// 7. add by default more categories, like bld, multi blind
// 10. read about connecting bluetooth cubes/stackmat timers to app?
// 12. ability to change amount of moves in scramble?
// 13. history of PB's - how they changed/fast overtime
// 16. Sessions should have some icons? User could pick predefined icon
// 17. If users adds time, and click "do not use this scramble" - maybe let him paste his own scramble?
// If it is set to hideUI - hide navigation bar as well.
// In timesList filters - add possibility to choose time-frame like last day/last week/last month

// ********************************** LOW **********************************
// 2. Timer numbers turns to yellow/red when you exceeds your avg5/avg12 time?
// 3. Timer shows only full seconds, without any milliseconds
// 5. Dimm screen down while solving?
// 6. Splash screen should be really looking good. It should have some kind of fading effect, animation should start when all assets are done fetching. Should use animated to do this.
// 7. OLL/PLL trainer, where user can choose one of X algs for each case, add his own alg, train one/all selected at the same time
// 7a. OLL/PLL trainers should have predefined sets of algs that top speedcubers uses, and maybe options to revert them from 180deg angle?
// 8. More advanced trainers like  VLS cases, ZBLL, and OLLCP
// 9. Multiphase timing feature, which lets you count each step in solve
// 10. Customization of AVG/MEANS to exact numbers which user chooses, not only to predefined ones
// 11. Daily statistics of solves, which shows avg of solves today
// 12. Scrambling trainer?
// 13. Let user choose vibration patterns and sound alerts in inspection settings
// 14. use expo storeReview package o ask for review after X solves? save in user that app asked for that already
// 15. Maybe create some walkthrough tutorials in app or maybe in form of video? About all features?
// 16. Add special tab where users will see scrambles that will produce nice looking patterns on cubes. Especially big cubes are interesting
// 17. Add easy scramble submission?
// 18. Add trainers for ROUX
// 19. In Solves list - when user selects times - let him mass edit them?
// 20. Maybe add option in inspection that will let user solve even when he exceeded inspection?
// 21. Add indicator that will tell used if current time is better/worse than his last time
