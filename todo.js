// ********************************** HIGH **********************************
// 1. list of solves which show list, each item acn be clicked and modal with solve editing shows. User can edit everything there
// 2. add "Warmup" mode where solves are not saved
// 3. add image of scrambled cube

// ********************************** MODERATE **********************************
// 1. Statistics based on days, not counting every solve?
// 2. set ready when front camera is covered?
// 3. set finished when there is any gyro movement
// 4. Export to CSV/ import/export compatible with csTimer
// 5. maybe add option to create own colors for whole app? and background image for timer screen? It should be dimmed by default
// 6. add "custom" cube option so users can add their own cube without scramble/ Maybe add "custom" and users will place there their sessions?
// 7. add by default more categories, like bld, multi blind
// 8. maybe create one big context with all data and reducers or REDUX? Or create one component that will provide all at once
// 9. work on implementing a great time adding feature, so it will be easy for ppl to use stackmats
// 10. read about connecting bluetooth cubes/stackmat timers to app?
// 11. ability to use the same scramble as before solve?
// 12. ability to change amount of moves in scramble?
// 13. history of PB's - how they changed/fast overtime
// 14. Add Avatar(maybe some default options), Nicknames(using Firestore)
// 15. Two way binding between firestore and realm database - userId/firebase UID

// ********************************** LOW **********************************
// 1. think about Adding sounds to app>?
// 2. Timer numbers turns to yellow/red when you exceeds your avg5/avg12 time?
// 3. Timer shows only full seconds, without any milliseconds
// 4. maybe 3 presets for how long to tap screen to start solve?
// 5. Read about not dimming screen/ not blocking screen while in use
// 6. Splash screen should be really looking good. It should have some kind of fading effect, animation should start when all assets are done fetching. Should use animated to do this.
// 7. OLL/PLL trainer, where user can choose one of X algs for each case, add his own alg, train one/all selected at the same time
// 8. More advanced trainers like  VLS cases, ZBLL, and OLLCP
// 9. Multiphase timing feature, which lets you count each step in solve
// 10. Customization of AVG/MEANS to exact numbers which user chooses, not only to predefined ones
// 11. Daily statistics of solves, which shows avg of solves today
// 12. Scrambling trainer?
